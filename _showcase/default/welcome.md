    <h2>Welcome to Showcase!</h2>

    <p>
        Now I live in the UK, a place I dreamed of living in since I was a child. The reason is simple, after all, it’s the closest I can get to Hogwarts, as a huge Harry Potter fan.

        I love traveling and photography, always carrying my cameras to capture moments and stories from everyday life. Besides beautiful landscapes, I’m also passionate about food, and I enjoy cooking Chinese dishes to share with family and friends.

        I have a puppy named Rosie, a cheerful and energetic West Highland White Terrier. She’s my first dog and is now 8 months old, bringing so much joy to my life.

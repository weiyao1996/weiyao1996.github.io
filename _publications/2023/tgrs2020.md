  This article introduces a novel deep learning-based multistage framework to accurately extract the road surface and road centerline simultaneously and demonstrates the superior performance of the proposed framework. Specifically, our method’s performance exceeded the other methods by 7% and 40% for the connectivity indicator for road surface segmentation and for the completeness indicator for centerline extraction, respectively.

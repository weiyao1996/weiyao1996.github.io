  To address the problems of previous road extraction methods, especially road connectivity and completeness, we introduce a novel deep learning-based multistage framework to accurately extract the road surface and road centerline simultaneously. Our framework consists of three steps: boosting segmentation, multiple starting points tracing, and fusion. We evaluated our method utilizing three data sets covering various road situations in more than 40 cities around the world. The results demonstrate the superior performance of our proposed framework. Specifically, our method’s performance exceeded the other methods by 7% and 40% for the connectivity indicator for road surface segmentation and for the completeness indicator for centerline extraction, respectively.
